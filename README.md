## 💻 Code Structure:

Each problem solution is provided in **Java** with well-commented code, making it easy to understand and reuse. Below is a sample structure of how the solutions are organized:

```java
// Filename: ReverseArray.java
// Category: Arrays
// Problem: Reverse an array
// Link to Problem: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-program-to-reverse-an-array-or-string/

public class ReverseArray {
    public static void reverseArray(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = arr[start];
            arr[start] = arr[end];
            arr[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        reverseArray(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
        System.out.println("Reversed array: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
    }
}
```
